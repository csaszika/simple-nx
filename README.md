# SimpleNx

Simple homework app with simplified architecture.

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve simple-nx
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build simple-nx
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project simple-nx
```

Note: 
Unit tests were not covered as it was not part of the tasks.
If you curious how I do unit testing, check out my article here: https://medium.com/@csaszika
